     1. About
    
     This script make possible viewing videos on video websites with a classic video plugin or with the HTML5 video player.
    
     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
     
     Limitations & Issues:
     -> If the script doesn't work as supposed to, reinstall it or/and clear browser cache/cookies.
     -> If the script doesn't load, refresh the video page.
     -> If a related video is open in the same page by replacing the current video, the script may not work. 
        Try to refresh the page or open related videos in new tabs/windows.
     -> On some sites there are videos embedded from an external source/site.
        The script doesn't work for these videos, but for some of them the script shows a link to the original video page.
     -> The script doesn't support playlists but you can watch each video from the playlist if you open it in a new tab/window.
     -> Embedded videos from these sites are not supported but I've made the LinkTube script that replaces the embedded videos
        with a link to the video page.

     -> Alt: videos are embedded with the EMBED element and played by the plugin associated with the video's mimetype
     -> HTML5: videos are embedded with the VIDEO element and played by the HTML5 video plugin
     -> MPEG|MP4|FLV: videos are played by the video plugin associated with these file types
     -> MPV: videos are played by mpv if this is the default video plugin associated with video/mp4 (see DVL)

     -> Totem: videos are played by the Totem video plugin (Linux)
     -> Xine: videos are played by the Xine video plugin (Linux)
 
     Autoplay (AP):
     -> Click 'Autoplay' button to turn autoplay on/off. If it's on, the video starts to play when the video page is loaded
        or when a new video format is selected. If it's off, a video thumbnail and a 'Play' button are shown.
 
     Definition (SD, HD etc):
     -> Click this button to change the default video definition.

     Direct Video Link (DVL):
     -> Click to enable/disable auto selection of DVL as the default option in the videos menu. With DVL only the video link

     5. Mods/addons
     
     Detach/pop-up player feature by Ram-Z
     -> This mod offers the option to detach the script's player into a standalone pop-up window in Firefox based browsers.

     ViewTube_GM by Trupf
     -> This mod is made to improve performance in Firefox. It is specially aimed at use with the VLC plugin but should
        not break compatibiliy with other plugins and probably improve Totem performance the same way as VLC.
